  The number of errors we’ve encountered trying to parse the feed content.
  Errors here are things like not well-formed xml, bad character encoding, etc.


  We fix many of these types of issues on the fly when parsing.
  We only increment the errors count when we can’t fix it.
type: integer
example: 0
