    This call returns every new feed and episode added to the index over the past 24 hours in reverse chronological order.


    This is similar to `/recent/feeds` but uses the date the feed was found by the index rather than the feed's
    internal timestamp.


    Similar data can also be accessed using object storage root url https://tracking.podcastindex.org/current
