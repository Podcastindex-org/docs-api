    Contains the raw data used to populate the graphs at https://stats.podcastindex.org/v4v.

    This is a look at the total [sats](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp) flowing through the Value4Value
    Lightning podcasting economy over various periods of time.

    We calculate this data based on our visibility as a one percent voluntary split on Podcastindex.org api
    calls. Therefore, the true numbers could be higher, but they cannot be lower than listed here. This represents our
    best approximation of how many sats are flowing across the entire ecosystem from listeners to creators, guests (via
    episode splits), platforms, services and apps.
