    This call returns every new feed and episode added to the index over the past 24 hours in reverse chronological order.


    This is similar to `/recent/feeds` but uses the date the feed was found by the index rather than the feed's
    internal timestamp.


    Similar data can also be retrieved using the API endpoint [recent/data](#get-/recent/data).


    Access at: https://tracking.podcastindex.org/current


    The prior 24 hours of data (going backwards until all tracked data is received) can be accessed using the timestamp
    of the previous data set. This is found in the `previousTrackingUrl`.
    The format of these prior data sets follows the format described below.
