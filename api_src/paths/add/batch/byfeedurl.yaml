  summary: By Feed URL Batch
  # language=Markdown
  description: |
    This call adds multiple feed urls at once.


    It returns an array listing the results of each one. If the feed existed already, or if it was added, you will get
    back its PodcastIndex.org feed id. If we have linkage to an iTunes ID for this feed it will be returned as well.


    There are also "error" and "valid" properties returned. A false in the "valid" property indicates the feed url was
    structurally invalid. A true in the "error" property indicates something went wrong internally while adding the feed.


    **NOTE**: this endpoint requires an API Key with the **publisher** permission.
